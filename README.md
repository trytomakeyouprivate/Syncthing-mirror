Explaining a setup how to sync between two Laptops

Syncthing is a great tool, it works locally or over the internet and allows secure and serverless synchronisation of data.

You dont need a cloud to have your stuff everywhere you want. And if thats at least 2 devices, the chances of losing it is already really low.

## Best practices
Try not to sync too many folders and prefer to maybe restructure your files. If you often need to change setups, this may help.

## PC to PC
My setup has a KDE desktop and nearly exclusively Flatpak apps. I use SyncThingy, which autostarts on login and works great.
